			"comment": "The name of the character is critical in determining how the stats are penalized.  There are two\npairs of stats that will always be penalized.  If a character has normal strength growth, then their\nmax MP will be penalized by 10%.  The opposite is true: if a character has normal MP growth, then\ntheir strength will be penalized by 10%.  The other pair of stats is agility and max HP.  If agility\nhas normal growth, the max HP will be penalized by 10% and vice versa.  The important thing to take\naway is that two stats will always be penalized while the other two are not.  A bonus of 0 to 3\npoints will be added to the 2 penalized stats.  This gives the effect of having the penalized stat\nslightly stronger at the beginning of the game but becomes weaker as the player progresses levels.\nOnly the first 4 letters in the name are used for the stat penalties and bonus calculations. Here\nis how it works:\nThe numeric value of the first four letters of the name are added together.  the following\nis a list of the numeric values of the characters:\nA=$24, B=$25, C=$26, D=$27, E=$28, F=$29, G=$2A, H=$2B, I=$2C, J=$2D,\nK=$2E, L=$2F, M=$30, N=$31, O=$32, P=$33, Q=$34, R=$35, S=$36, T=$37,\nU=$38, V=$39, W=$3A, X=$3B, Y=$3C, Z=$3D, -=$49, '=$40, !=$4C, ?=$4B,\n(=$4F, )=$4E, a=0A$, b=$0B, c=$0C, d=$0D, e=$0E, f=$0F, g=$10, h=$11,\ni=$12, j=$13, k=$14, l=$15, m=$16, n=$17, o=$18, p=$19, q=$1A, r=$1B,\ns=$1C, t=$1D, u=$1E, v=$1F, w=$20, x=$21, y=$22, z=$23, ,=$48, .=$47,\nspace=$60\nBits 0 and 1 are used to determine the stat penalties. Bits 2 and 3 are the stats bonus.\nIf bit 0 is clear, strength is penalized by 10%. If bit 0 is set, max MP is penalized by 10%.\nif bit 1 is clear, agility is penalized by 10%. If bit 1 is set, max HP is penalized by 10%.\nBits 2 and 3 are shifted down to bits 0 and 1 and added to the penalized stats.\nSome examples:\nJAKE = $2D+$24+$2E+$28 = $A7. Max MP penalized, max HP penalized, +1 added to max MP, HP.\nDeez = $27+$0E+$0E+$23 = $66. Strength penalized, max HP penalized, +1 added to strength, max HP.\nThe best combination would be to have the lowest 4 bits be 1111. This would reduce max HP and MP\nbut give a bonus of 3 points to each. Strength and agility would have normal growth.",
