# Session Log: Chip's Challenge Disassembly Setup
**Date:** 2026-02-17
**Project:** game-garden
**Game:** Chip's Challenge (Atari Lynx)

## Session Goals

1. Extract and verify Chip's Challenge ROM
2. Create project scaffold in game-garden
3. Run initial Peony disassembly
4. Document findings and create plans

## Work Completed

### ROM Extraction and Verification

1. Extracted from `Atari Lynx (GoodLynx v2.01).rar` archive
2. ROM file: `Chip's Challenge (1989).lnx`
3. Size: 131,136 bytes (64-byte LNX header + 131,072-byte ROM)

**Checksums:**
- MD5: `ad3d091ba4250d0354bc6d3fd8c9a882`
- SHA1: `92af2d566c6bbf626a21dbfa41af16d73e0a774d`
- SHA256: `5a55f01511e382297f86b073f71f7e1b504762d323a0c7e8ee2bbc1e6633ce45`

**LNX Header Info (from Peony):**
- Cart Name: chipchal.lnx
- Manufacturer: Atari
- Rotation: None
- Bank0 Size: 128KB
- Entry Point: $0200

### Initial Disassembly

- Ran Peony disassembler
- 4 code blocks identified (1 more than California Games)
- Low code coverage due to Lynx encrypted boot loader
- CDL data needed for proper disassembly

### GitHub Issue Created

- Created issue #11: [Lynx] Chip's Challenge Disassembly
- Labels: lynx, disassembly, enhancement

## Key Findings

1. **Boot Loader Challenge:** Like California Games, the entry point at $0200
   points to encrypted/compressed boot loader data. Real code locations
   require CDL tracing.

2. **144 Levels:** The game contains 144 puzzle levels, meaning significant
   level data structures exist in the ROM. Identifying these is a priority.

3. **Level Format Research:** The Windows version file format is documented at
   https://www.seasip.info/ccfile.html - may provide hints for Lynx format.

## Challenges

- **Encrypted Boot:** Standard Lynx issue
- **Level Data:** Need to identify level storage format
- **No CDL:** Requires emulator tracing for full disassembly

## Next Steps

1. Generate CDL file by tracing gameplay in Mednafen
2. Re-run Peony with CDL for improved code coverage
3. Research Windows CC level format for comparison
4. Identify level data boundaries in ROM
5. Extract tile graphics
6. Document level format
